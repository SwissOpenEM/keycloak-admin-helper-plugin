    ## This step uses [docker/metadata-action](https://github.com/docker/metadata-action#about) to extract tags and labels that will be applied to the specified image. The `id` "meta" allows the output of this step to be referenced in a subsequent step. The `images` value provides the base name for the tags and labels.

    # This step uses the `docker/build-push-action` action to build the image, based on your repository's `Dockerfile`. If the build succeeds, it pushes the image to GitHub Packages.
    # It uses the `context` parameter to define the build's context as the set of files located in the specified path. For more information, see [Usage](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action#usage) in the README of the `docker/build-push-action` repository.
